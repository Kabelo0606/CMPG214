# CMPG214 SU2 Individual Reflection

## 1. Principles of SU2
In this section, I will discuss the fundamental principles that guided my understanding and application of the SU2 framework during the coursework. These principles emphasized the importance of adaptability, strategic decision-making, and the need for a balance between collaboration and competition.

## 2. Communication Failures
Throughout the simulation, several communication failures became apparent. Key moments where miscommunication occurred included team meetings where important updates were not shared adequately, leading to disjointed efforts and duplicated work. Identifying the root causes of these failures is crucial for improving future teamwork.

## 3. Concrete Changes
In response to the identified failures, I would implement concrete changes including more structured communication protocols, regular check-ins, and the establishment of a central information hub for all team members to access vital information. These changes aim to enhance clarity and ensure all team members are aligned with objectives and updates.
