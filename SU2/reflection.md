# CMPG214 SU2 Individual Reflection

Student Number: 55647928

## Which SU2 principle was hardest to apply — and why?

The hardest principle to apply was channel richness. RetailCo's crisis required an ambiguous, time-sensitive, emotionally charged message—precisely the scenario demanding a rich channel. Yet the CIO chose email (lean channel), preventing the CEO from asking clarifying questions in real-time. The CEO couldn't understand "SQL injection" or ask "how urgent is this?" A face-to-face or phone call would have allowed immediate dialogue and reduced the 6-hour response delay.

## What failed in the original crisis communication?

The failure was a form-function mismatch. The CIO's email violated the plain language principle by using technical jargon ("SQL injection vector exploit," "lateral movement," "remediation cadence"). The function was unclear—was this informing or requesting a decision? The sequencing failed: external stakeholders learned first through Twitter, before internal leadership understood the situation.

## What would you change if this were real?

I would mandate a phone call from the CIO to the CEO within 15 minutes of breach confirmation, not an email. Channel richness theory proves ambiguous crisis messages need rich channels for immediate clarification and decision-making authority, preventing cascading failures.
