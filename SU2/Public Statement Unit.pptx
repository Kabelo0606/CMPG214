#Task Force 3 — Public Communication Team
#Media Hangling Unit

My task was to prepare 3Q&A responses for a press conference

##How many customer's banking details were exposed, and what should they do now?  
Approximately 814,000 customers who used direct debit had banking details compromised. We are working closely with banks to monitor suspicious activity and we advise affected customers to remain vigilant. While we provide direct guidance and support.

##Why did you fail to notify the Information Regulator and customers immediately, as required by Popia?  
Our priority was to contain the breach before issuing formal notifications. We are now fully cooperating with the Information Regulator. We have been monitoring customers and committed to a full transparency going forward.

##Why did it take you 6 hours to respond publicly?  
We acknowledge that our initial response time was not fast enough. The delay was due to internal investigations and verification. We have since implemented new protocols to ensure immediate communication in future incidents.
